                    <p> The Ottawa Baseball Mock-Up features a large header portraying a brightly coloured logo for the Baseball Application. The integrated Google map interface is located on the left side of the app. It utilizes approximately 75% of its width. When clicking on a location, a single screen will appear within the Google map with more information and give an indication of the distance from the users location and a rating system. The right side features the list of locations. The list items will be displayed with semi-transparent opacity, so that the baseball diamond background is visible. There will be tabs above the list so that the user can sort the information. There is a button that links to the Admin section, which allows the admin users to add,edit,and delete locations.</p>

                    <p> The Ottawa Baseball Application is designed for two audiences.
                    
                    The Primary Users are people aged 16 and over, who have access to a vehicle. They may use this application to seek out baseball diamonds, with their most desired ratings. Where as location is not an issue.
                    
                    The Secondary Users are those who are typically 16 and under, or those who do not have access to a vehicle. They would use the application to find baseball diamonds with the closest proximity.
